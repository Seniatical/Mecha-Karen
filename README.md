<h1 align="center">Running Karen</h1>
<p align="">
  Running KAREN is not easy - Mainly due to missing modules and parts. Some modules have also been customised to suit karens running style - of which I do not include in this repo.<br>
  I will not make it easy for anybody - If you wish to run it, modify some areas of the bot and you should be good to go!<br>
  This repo is not meant to be directly copied as it contains pre-releases which are very unstable and are never used in production, The purpose of this repo is for testing and helping to improve the bot!
</p>

<h2 align="center">Basic Use of Running Karen</h2>
<p align="">
    This area will show you the major steps of running Mecha-Karen on your machine. If you run into any errors which are related to the steps below, contact me on Discord so I can issue a fix for the issue.<br><br>
    If it due to the code - A majority of the causes are stated in the repo in relevant sections, so give them a read before asking for help.<br>
    I will not help or provide support for self hosting Karen.<br>
    If you are self hosting Karen - please make sure to follow the license.<br>
    This project has had a lot of time and effort invested into it, so I would appreciate it if credit was given.<br>
