TESTERS :

  Breadcrumbs#9022 : 510774649299402792 {
      Been with me since the start of this bot.
      Found various bugs and helped me along the way with small things.
  }
  
  Benny#5257 : 249444376449777664 {
      Found almost every spelling mistake and helped launch Mecha Karen during it's early stages.
      Gave good suggestions such as the BreakingBad command.
  }
  
  Crepco#6969 : 704701290306994308 {
      Tested a lot of the commands and gave me the errors it produced.
      Without his help a lot of the commands would still be broken.
      A lot of support from him. A true legend.
  }
  
  Plebus Supremus#1234 : 719046255325741057 {
      Same as Crepco. He tested a lot of the commands and has helped launch Mecha Karen.
      He helped me with many errors and has kept me motivated throughout the time hes been here.
      He is also the reason why this repo is constantly getting updated :p
  }
  
  Without these testers, Mecha Karen would still be very unstable mostly due to stupid errors that break it.
  Thanks to them all, Mecha Karen is rising and it's features are growing as I can focus less on those errors.
  Thank you.
